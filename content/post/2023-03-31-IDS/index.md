At the end of March 2023, the [Initiation to the Scientific Approach course](https://directory.unamur.be/teaching/courses/INFOB302) poster session was held in the Faculty of Computer Science entrance hall. The course aims to provide bachelor's and master's students with a basis for decoding, analyzing and designing a research question, as well as the experimental protocol to answer it. For their poster, the students had to analyze a research paper and present the experimental protocol defined in it. The teacher's (Prof. Xavier Devroey) task was to discuss the 14 posters over 2 hours... The final result: mission accomplished for all! In the last lecture, Prof. Benoît Vanderose gave a much-appreciated seminar on the links between scientific method and critical thinking, in his very own style. Finally, the course was the subject of a presentation at the Grand banquet of inspiring pedagogical practices organized by the [PUNCH team](https://www.unamur.be/punch) in May 2023, which made it possible to establish links with the BUMP library training team, who will intervene in the course this year 2023-2024 to give a seminar on bibliographic research.
