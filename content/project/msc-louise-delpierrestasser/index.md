This project examines how software developers can best balance human expertise and AI automation in core tasks such as programming, documentation, and requirements management. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of both approaches, the project aims to establish clear criteria for deciding when to employ manual solutions versus AI-powered tools. Ultimately, the goal is to identify scenarios where collaboration between humans and AI can most effectively improve the efficiency and quality of software development.

The internship is done with Prof. Carolin Brandt at the SERG Group, TU Delft.
