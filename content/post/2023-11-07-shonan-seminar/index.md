Last November 2023, I took part in the [Shonan seminar on the use of DevOps approaches for cyber-physical systems](https://shonan.nii.ac.jp/seminars/204/). It was an intense but interesting week, with 30 researchers from Japan, America and Europe, experts in software engineering, DevOps approaches and cyber-physical systems. In addition to the connections between research teams and future collaborations, the seminar helped to define a common vision of what a DevOps approach for cyber-physical systems is. This vision will be embodied in a book, to be written in the months following the seminar.
