abstract: "Basic Block Coverage (BBC) is a secondary objective for search- based unit test generation techniques relying on the approach level and branch distance to drive the search process. Unlike the approach level and branch distance, which considers only information related to the coverage of explicit branches coming from conditional and loop statements, BBC also takes into account implicit branchings (e.g., a runtime exception thrown in a branchless method) denoted by the coverage level of relevant basic blocks in a control flow graph to drive the search process. Our implementation of BBC for unit test generation relies on the DynaMOSA algorithm and EvoSuite. This paper summarizes the results achieved by EvoSuiteâ€™s DynaMOSA implementation with BBC as a secondary objective at the SBST 2022 unit testing tool competition."
