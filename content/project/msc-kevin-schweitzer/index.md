This project examines the methodological impacts of integrating artificial intelligence within a development team. It explores how AI alters established team processes, affects collaboration, and changes the decision-making landscape for developers. The goal is to identify both the opportunities and challenges that arise when AI technologies are adopted, focusing on process improvement, role adaptation, and best practices for efficient and effective AI-driven software development.

The internship is done with Prof. Houari Sahraoui at the Université de Montréal.
