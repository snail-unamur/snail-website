title: "DeFlake: Exploring test flakiness debugging"
summary: "Flaky tests are nondeterministic tests, they can give different results without changes to the code. This wastes time and resources. A better understanding of this field should lead to a decrease of these inconveniences. However, there is little work that makes the effort to bring this knowledge together. This is why this thesis will propose to answer these questions What are the categories of flaky tests identified? and What debugging techniques are the most appropriate for the different categories of flaky tests?"

Flaky tests are nondeterministic tests, they can give different results without changes to the code. This wastes time and resources. A better understanding of this field should lead to a decrease of these inconveniences. However, there is little work that makes the effort to bring this knowledge together.
This is why this thesis will propose to answer these questions "What are the categories of flaky tests identified?" and "What debugging techniques are the most appropriate for the different categories of flaky tests?"
To do this, a mapping study and a systematic review of the literature have been set up. This will allow us to take stock of current knowledge. To present the different categories proposed as well as their classifications. Without forgetting to discuss the needs and desires of developers for the future.
We will also see that the research should not stop there, as there is not yet a strong proposal to link the categories to debugging techniques. Research work is still needed to come up with methods that bring together all the proposed tools and techniques.
