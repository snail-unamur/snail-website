On February 10th, [Professor Cynthia Liem](https://www.cynthialiem.com) from the Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands visited us at the Computer Science Faculty. This was an opportunity to talk about her research on verification and validation of machine learning models in different contexts and the fundamental questions this raises.

Professor Liem conducts her research in the Multimedia Computing Group. She is an expert in AI trustworthiness, a classical musician, and an active advocate for science outreach. Her research focuses on verification and validation of data-driven systems and how to keep "what is not apparent" at hand in an information overloaded world. Professor Liem has a strong background in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research, including machine learning and software engineering, music, and social sciences. 

This meeting was an opportunity for doctoral students from the SNAIL lab and the faculty to present their work and to discuss and debate with an expert in the field.
