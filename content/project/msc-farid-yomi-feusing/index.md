This dissertation explores the impact of using natural language in the visualisation of
open datasets, focusing on the design and evaluation of Aladdin, a system based on the DSR
approach. Aladdin uses advanced natural language processing techniques to transform text
queries into interactive data visualisations. 

The methodological approach details the development of Aladdin through three main
DSR cycles: the Rigor Cycle for the theoretical analysis and definition of objectives, the Design
Cycle for the design and implementation of the solution, and the Relevance Cycle for evaluation
in real-life conditions. The system is based on React for the user interface, MongoDB for data
management and FastAPI for a robust API, with the GPT-4 model for the semantic analysis of
queries.

The evaluation of Aladdin confirms its role in improving the accessibility and efficiency of
open data visualisation, with positive feedback on the accuracy of interpretations and the quality
of visualisations. However, the management of complex queries needs to be strengthened, and
the shortcomings of the LLM support need to be remedied. Future prospects include integrating
with other analytical platforms and improving user interaction, while extending Aladdin's
accessibility via OpenData portals to increase its functionality and adoption.
