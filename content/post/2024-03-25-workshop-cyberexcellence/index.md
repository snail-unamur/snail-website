On March 25 and 26, 2024, together with the researchers involved in the [CyberExcellence project](https://www.cyberexcellence.be), the flagship research project of the [IIS CyberWal](https://www.digitalwallonia.be/cyberwal/) by [DigitalWallonia](https://www.digitalwallonia.be), we visited the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT) at the University of Luxembourg.

With the participation of over 40 consortium members, the aim was to exchange information on the progress of respective research projects developed at CyberExcellence and at the University of Luxembourg, to explore new avenues of collaboration and to strengthen links between the teams. Relations between the Faculty of Computer Science and the University of Luxembourg date back to 2003, the year in which the Luxembourg university was founded. Since then, there have been many exchanges with SnT, both in terms of research projects and master's students (including [SNAIL MSc students](https://snail.info.unamur.be/mscthesis/)). The two-day visit was an opportunity to strengthen this link and discuss future collaborations involving other CyberExcellence members.
