The new Verification and Validation (V&V) course includes exercise sessions in which students write tests for [small Java programs](https://github.com/UNamurCSFaculty/INFOM124-Software-verification-and-validation). These exercises use [Andy](https://github.com/cse1110/andy) to receive feedback in the form of coverage indicators, mutation score and number of successful meta-tests. The aim of this thesis is to apply a gamification approach to these exercises in order to increase student involvement: TEGa, you can't help it!
