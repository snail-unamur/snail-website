A bitter cold, but a good atmosphere for an intense week! The presentations of the CyberWal in Galaxia Winterschool continued all week from December 13 to 16, 2022 at the Eurospace center in Redu. The [CyberWal consortium](https://cyberwal.be) brings together researchers working on cybersecurity within the universities of the Walloon-Brussels Federation and accredited research centers.

On Thursday morning, Professor Xavier Devroey gave an introductory lecture on testing and Fuzzing, a technique to randomly generate inputs for a system. Thursday afternoon was devoted to practical work, supervised by Guillaume Ginis, researcher at CETIC and Guillaume Nguyen, PhD student from the SNAIL laboratory, funded by the CyberExcellence project of the Walloon region and working on the deployment of Fuzzing for cyber-physical systems within Walloon companies.
