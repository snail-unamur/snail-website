This doctoral research project aims to comprehensively map the intricate relationship between individual personality and the full spectrum of agile concepts.

The study deconstructs "agility" into its core, hierarchical components: from the overarching agile mindset and the four foundational values of the Manifesto, down to the twelve guiding principles and the wide range of specific day-to-day practices.

Using established personality frameworks like the Big Five model, the research investigates how different personality traits correlate with an individual's affinity for, and potential success within, each of these distinct agile layers. The ultimate goal is to move beyond a simplistic "agile vs. non-agile" dichotomy and provide a nuanced framework that helps organizations understand, predict, and cultivate the human factors essential for a successful and sustainable agile transformation.
