In this thesis, the student will be asked to design a web framework that will enable a developer to design an application that can be deployed as a website, desktop application, mobile application and immersive augmented and virtual reality application. One of the aspects that will be particularly studied is the framework's ability to offer simple, explicit and intuitive commands for managing interface elements within 2D and 3D environments.
