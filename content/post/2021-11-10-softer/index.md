Last week was the first edition of the [Greater Region Software Engineering Research Days (SOFTER)](https://gr-softer.github.io/), organised in Namur. It was the occasion for researchers from the [Serval team](https://serval-snt.github.io) of the SnT, University of Luxembourg ,and researchers from the VERTIGO and [SNAIL](https://snail.info.unamur.be) teams of the Namur Digital Institute (NaDI), University of Namur, to meet and discuss during two days around testing and verification, machine learning robustness, architecture quality assurance, code analysis, and machine learning for industry 4.0. The seminar finished with a presentation of recent and new research directions in machine learning for financial technology. The seminar featured a brainstorming session, and researchers involved in a session collectively prepared a joint presentation to introduce the topic to other attendees and show how their research contribute to advance the area, contributing to a successful and highly interactive first edition of SOFTER!
