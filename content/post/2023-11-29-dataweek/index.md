On Wednesday November 29, 2023, we were invited to the 5th edition of the [Dataweek](https://dataweek.be), organized by HÃ©nallux, to talk about artificial intelligence and software development. After a general introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) and their use with ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, we examined their concrete impact on developers' daily lives. Starting from the observation that many of us share: "LLMs are good for producing code, ok, but what's next?" we unpacked how this revolution was still only local. Yes, we generate bits of code, but are we ready to let LLMs tackle complete projects such as information systems? And by the way, what is programming really? Isn't it basically specifying behavior in a structured way? In short, we've deconstructed the myth that AI threatens their jobs as developers. On the contrary, it's redefining our roles and shifting the boundaries. Just as Emmet didn't make webdesigners disappear, LLMs, represented here by ChatGPT, are not our enemies, but allies who are rewriting the rules of the development game. Ready to dive into this revolution?
