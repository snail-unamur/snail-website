## Adding elements to the SNAIL Website

### Team members

Team members are listed in [content/authors/](content/authors/). Each team member has its own subdirectory, corresponding to their **firstname-lastname**. *Please use this identifier of the members of the team (i.e., firstname-lastname) instead of their full name when encoding authors for publications, projects, and news to ensure proper linking on the website.*

Each user must be part of one of the following user groups (`user_groups:` in the `_index.md` of the user):
- Faculty
- Researchers
- PhD Students
- MSc Students
- Alumni

More groups can be added in the [content/people/people.md](content/people/people.md) file.

Check [Wowchemy documentation](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/authors/) to know more about profiles content.


Hugo command to add a team member:

```
hugo new --kind authors authors/eid
```

### Projects

Projects are listed in [content/project/](content/project/). Each project has its own subdirectory, which respects the format:

- `msc-firstname-lastname` for master thesis projects. Those projects **must** include the following tags to ensure proper rendering:
```
tags:
  - Msc Thesis
  - (Finished|Ongoing)
```

- `phd-firstname-lastname` for PhD thesis projects. Those projects **must** include the following tags to ensure proper rendering:
```
tags:
  - PhD Thesis
  - (Finished|Ongoing)
```

- `project-id` for (funded) research projects that are not PhD thesis projects (like FRIA or FNRS scholarships). Those projects **must** include the following tags to ensure proper rendering:
```
tags:
  - Funded
  - (Finished|Ongoing)
```

Hugo command to add a project:

```
hugo new --kind project project/msc-firstname-lastname
```

### Publications

Publications are available in [content/publication/](content/publication/). Each publication has its own subdirectory, corresponding to the key `first author's last name-year`, followed by a letter if multiple publications have been accepted on the same year. Each folder should contain:

- `index.md` contains the information about the publication, following the format detailed at [https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/publications/](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/publications/).

- `cite.bib` contains the reference to the publication in Bibtex format.

- `featured.(png|jpg)` is a figure used as a preview of the paper, displayed before the abstract.

Alternatively, one can use the [Hugo Academic CLI](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-academic-cli/) tool to automatically import publications from BibTeX. Please make sure that the Bibtex key follows the `first author's last name-year` format before the import (or you will have to rename all the folders manually).

Hugo command to add a publication:

```
hugo new --kind publication publication/lastname-2020
```

### Posts and news

News are available in [content/post/](content/post/). Each news has its own subdirectory respecting the format `year-month-day-id`. Check the documentation on blog posts at [https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/blog-posts/](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/blog-posts/).

Hugo command to add a news:

```
hugo new --kind post post/2020-10-08-mynews
```

### Checklist before commit

Please check before comiting your changes that:

- authors of the SNAIL team  have been added using their identifier, corresponding to the name of the folder [content/author/](content/author/) (for example, `xavier-devroey` or `benoit-vanderose`), to ensure proper referencing on the website.

- the tags you used make sense and are consistent with the existing tags. Have a look at the list available on the [SNAIL website](https://snail.info.unamur.be/tags/) or add you own tags for new research topics.   

- the projects linked to the publication or post have been properly referenced. For instance, if the publication is part of a master or phd thesis, add the reference to the list of projects
```
projects:
  - mscthesis-xyz
```
