While workstations (including monitors, keyboard and mouse as peripherals) have long been the most common installation for computer-intensive employees, the arrival of powerful, versatile tablets and telephones has been shaking up this organization of work in many professions for some years now. Software development, on the other hand, remains very attached to this type of installation. The aim of this thesis is therefore to explore the extent to which recent advances in software engineering (dockerization, static code analysis, etc.) could enable the development of a nomadic code review environment as efficient as the traditional model.
