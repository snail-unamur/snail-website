On Monday, January 9, 2023, the faculty welcomed [FORMaNAM](https://www.formanam.be) and [Interface3.Namur](https://www.interface3namur.be) for the official launch of the project *Gender Equals Future: 011 for IT*, which is part of the [Woman In Digital plan of the SPF Economie](https://economie.fgov.be/fr/themes/line/inclusion-numerique/women-digital). Dr. Julie Henry, STEAM project leader at the University of Namur, is the coordinator of the project. The objective is to formulate suggestions and recommendations for educational institutions in order to encourage the retention of women in digital training. Also involved are doctors Fanny Boraita and Catherine Bernard and professors Beno√Æt Vanderose and Xavier Devroey of the SNAIL team.
