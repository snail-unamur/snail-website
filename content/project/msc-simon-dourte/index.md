This thesis explores the integration of sonification and gamification in development environments in order to reduce the cognitive load on developers and improve their user experience. A state-of-the-art review was conducted based on scientific literature in various fields such as cognitive load, sonification, and gamification. Subsequently, a tool called EchoCode was developed to address the issue. It is an extension for Visual Studio Code that integrates the concepts of sonification and gamification. This extension offers three main features : personalized audio feedback associated with keyboard shortcuts, audio feedback that adapts according to the execution of a program (failure or success), and an integrated To-Do List with two operating modes to structure tasks in a software development context. This approach aims to relieve the visual channel, support working memory, and maintain optimal concentration.

The tool was evaluated through user tests combining qualitative measurements (questionnaires, Think Aloud method) and quantitative measurements (User Experience Questionnaire). The results show high attractiveness and good comprehensibility, confirming the value of the approach, although sensitivity to the sound dimension varies depending on the profile. Improvements are proposed to take the tool further, including ex- tending sound feedback, automating certain interactions, and conducting a long-term evaluation of the impact on developers’ productivity and well-being.
