We are the Software Normalization Assessment and Improvement Lab, a team of researchers from the [Computer Science Faculty of the University of Namur](https://www.unamur.be/info) and the [PReCISE research group of the Namur Digital Institute](https://nadi.unamur.be/research-centers/precise) of the University of Namur.

Our team seeks to advance the state-of-the-art and practice of software engineering to improve software reliability by considering quality assessment and testing in both their human and technical contexts.

Our topics of interest include (but are far from limited to):
- agile methods
- software quality assessment
- automated software testing
- search-based software engineering

We know a thing or two about research but are also very aware of the importance of keeping in touch with practitioners in a field such as Software Engineering. We therefore aim to collaborate with the industry to capture actual needs and provide practical solutions to practical issues.  

This is what we do: [research](/research) and [MSc thesis](/mscthesis).
