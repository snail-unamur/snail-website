The new Verification and Validation (V&V) course includes sessions where students write tests for small Java programs. Previously, a thesis explored a gamification approach centered on competition, using a leaderboard to compare studentsâ€™ scores. This thesis aims to explore alternative gamification methods focused on student collaboration and to compare their effectiveness with the competitive approach used in the past thesis.

This thesis is a continuation of [our previous work with Thibaut Berg](https://snail.info.unamur.be/project/msc-thibaut-berg/).
