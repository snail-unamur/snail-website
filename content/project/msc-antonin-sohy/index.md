This master thesis explores the design and validation of a context management tool integrated into a development environment. Developers constantly use various resources (documentation, terminal, development tools, etc.), which forces them to frequently switch between their development environment and these resources to meet their needs. This often leads to interruptions, distractions, and consequently, a drop in productivity. To address this issue, the study proposes a solution in the form of an extension for the Visual Studio Code IDE, called FlowTabs. This extension brings resources together into a unified interface and uses a relevance algorithm that adapts to the developerâ€™s behavior to suggest the most appropriate resources. User testing has shown that it integrates well into the development environment, offering a satisfactory developer experience, cognitive comfort and effective resource management. This work thus provides an original context management solution, directly embedded in a development environment.
