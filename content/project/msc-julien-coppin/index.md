This thesis investigates the impacts and challenges of integrating CLING, a test generator for Java, into CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines. In a context where test automation is essential to ensure software quality, CLING generates integration tests automatically. Integrating this tool into a Docker environment standardizes and isolates the environments, thus ensuring consistent test execution. The work addresses the technical challenges encountered during this integration, such as configuring and automating necessary operations. It also describes the development of the API used to manage the data generated by CLING. The results show an improvement in the efficiency of the development process, particularly through the reduction of manual interventions. Finally, the thesis offers recommendations for developers and DevOps engineers looking to optimize the integration of test generators into their CI/CD pipelines.
