At the end of the quarter, it is time to look back and see what the coming year will bring. The SNAIL team seeks to advance software engineering practice to improve software reliability by considering quality and testing in human and technical contexts. These dimensions are reflected in the research topics of the team's PhD students: Abiola is working on the recommendation of open data visualizations, Nicolas M. is working on cognitive biases linked to development methods, while Nicolas R. is working on the socio-technical debt linked to software development and maintenance. Martin is studying the possibility of using generative AIs to simplify the understanding of source code, Guillaume is working on recommending fuzzing techniques for cyber-physical systems, and Jérôme is working to raise developers' awareness of the energy consumption of their code. The mini-AG was also an opportunity to introduce the MSc students joining the team in the second quarter of 2023-2024.
