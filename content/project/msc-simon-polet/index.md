Amid growing concern over filter bubbles and content diversity, this thesis explores the impact of feedback mechanisms on user experience with YouTubeâ€™s recommendation algorithm. The study examines how increased user control can influence their interactions with the algorithm. Based on user interviews, personas were created to understand user behaviors and expectations. A Chrome extension was developed to allow users to report errors in their recommendation feed. Results indicate that this mechanism enhances user satisfaction and a sense of control, though some limitations suggest areas for future improvements. The study also proposes a methodology to evaluate contextual thematic diversity on YouTube, paving the way for further research into recommendation diversity and self-actualization systems.
