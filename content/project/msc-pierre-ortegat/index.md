Nowadays, many learning platforms offer automatic correction for programming exercises. This is the case, for example, with the  [INGInious](https://inginious.org) platform. However, most of these platforms require a long time to set up, partially due to the number of tests to be written for each exercise. Most of those exercises consist in writing simple programs, for which it could be possible to generate tests automatically.
The goal of this master thesis is to study how automatic test generation tools can help reduce this setup time by automatically generating tests for different exercises. This generation can be done from a specification describing the piece of code expected from the student or from a given solution. In the context of this thesis, the target programming language is the same as that used in the first year of the bachelor's degree at University of Namur: Python.
