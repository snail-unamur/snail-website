Researchers and practitioners have developed automated test case generators for various languages and platforms, each with different strengths. Comparing these tools requires large-scale empirical evaluations, which demand significant setup and analysis. The JUnit Generation benchmarking infrastructure (JUGE) automates the production and comparison of Java unit tests for multiple purposes, aiming to streamline evaluation, support knowledge transfer, and standardize practices. This masterâ€™s thesis will use the existing [JUGE infrastructure](https://github.com/JUnitContest/JUGE) to conduct an extensive empirical comparison of unit test generators for Java, and provide the resulting dataset to the research community.
