The *Gender Equals Future* project, led by the University of Namur and conducted in collaboration with [Interface3.Namur](https://www.interface3namur.be) and [Form@Nam](https://www.formanam.be), is part of the [Woman In Digital](https://economie.fgov.be/fr/themes/line/inclusion-numerique/women-digital) plan of the SPF Economie. More specifically, it studies the influence of teaching methods and environmental factors on girls and women in STEM disciplines and ICT programs. The final objective is to formulate suggestions and recommendations for educational institutions in order to foster access and retention of women in STEM disciplines and promote gender equality.

The participation of professors Beno√Æt Vanderose and Xavier Devroey from the SNAIL team will allow them to implement these recommendations in their bachelor courses and to measure their impact through in situ observations and semi-structured interviews.
