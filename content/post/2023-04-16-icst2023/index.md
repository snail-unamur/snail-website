Busy week for the SNAIL team at the [International Conference on Software Testing (ICST) 2023](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icst-2023)! [First presentation of his work](https://snail.info.unamur.be/publication/balfroid-2023/) by Martin Balfroid at the TestEd workshop. It was an opportunity to meet experts from the software verification and validation community and to discuss the latest advances in the field. Xavier Devroey presented [a journal article describing the JUGE infrastructure](https://snail.info.unamur.be/publication/devroey-2022/) for evaluating unit test generators in Java.
